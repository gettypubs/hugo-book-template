## Overview

 Hugo Skeleton is a supersimple theme for rapid website development with [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp).

 Look how easy it is to use:

 `$ gulp`

## Features
- Layout templates based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).
- Simple gulp workflow:
  - SASS Transpiler, Autoprefixer and Minifier.
  - JS Linter and Minifier.
  - Watch by default
- Boilerplate for SASS code organization inspired by the [Sass Guidelines project](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture).
- No over-engineering.

## Who you should use it
 - You want to quickly create websites or prototypes.
 - You think Hugo is really good at generating static sites but lacks an asset pipeline.
 - You are comfortable with Gulp as a task runner but don't want to spend too much time configuring it.
 - You favor SASS over another transpiler to generate CSS. You also understand the importance of proper SCSS organization.

## Installation
Please make sure that you have `npm` [installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [updated](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

1. Use the [installation instructions in the Hugo documentation to install Hugo.](http://gohugo.io/overview/installing/)
2. Clone this project into your `themes/` directory.
3. `cd` into `themes/hugo-skeleton` and run `npm install`.
4. Optional: Add `theme = "hugo-skeleton"` to your config.toml, so you don't have to pass the theme name as a command line argument.

## Running
Instructions are based on a standard Hugo installation.

1. Run `hugo server --verbose`. Verbose flag is highly recommended for debugging purposes.
2. Run `gulp`.
3. Enjoy.

## Project structure
The project follows the structure when [creating a new Hugo theme](http://gohugo.io/tutorials/creating-a-new-theme/). You should be familiar with the files when you finished the (excellent) tutorial. Additionally there is a `src` folder which contains all the JS and SCSS source files and some configuration files.
